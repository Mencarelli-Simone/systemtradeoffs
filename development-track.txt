Order in which the files where added to the project + description:

- unambiguous-imaging-design-analysis.ipynb
    for a given ideal antenna size and a point in the range-prf plane plots the RASR and AASR and
    identifies the swath width and Doppler undersampling ratio which guarantee RASR and AASR levels below a
    given threshold.
- unambiguous_imaging_design_analysis.py
    combines all the steps in the jupyter notebook into a function and provides a main test function to analyze
    individual design solutions manually.
- unambiguous-imaging-design-mapping.ipynb
        the idea is to make some surface plots over the TD space to compare:
            resolution degradation for a fixed minimum AASR,
            swath portion over which RASR excedes a certain treshold,
            peak core snr, maybe also the doppler underprocessed snr over the usable swath (this way is only a few samples)
            NEXT what happens morphing the antenna size?
- aasr-mapping.ipynb
        map the AASR function to understand what's happening:
        there was an error in the AASR function causing the last replica gain to shoot to 1.
        it was fixed by reducing the maximum order to 1 replica before the horizon.
        # todo  check the aasr is fixed also in the ship detection projects
- unambiguous-imaging-design-boundaries.ipynb
        #todo
        define some methods to nicely plot the design limits e.g. setting a threshold on the minimum swath width and
        minimum ground resolution.
