Order in which the files where added to the project + description:

- unambiguous-imaging-design-analysis.ipynb
    for a given ideal antenna size and a point in the range-prf plane plots the RASR and AASR and
    identifies the swath width and Doppler undersampling ratio which guarantee RASR and AASR levels below a
    given threshold.
- unambiguous-imaging-design-analysis.py
    combines all the steps in the jupyter notebook into a function and provides a main test function to analyze
    individual design solutions manually.
- unambiguous-imaging-design-mapping.ipynb
        the idea is to make some surface plots over the TD space to compare:
            resolution degradation for a fixed minimum AASR,
            swath portion over which RASR excedes a certain treshold,
            peak core snr
            NEXT what happens morphing the antenna size?
